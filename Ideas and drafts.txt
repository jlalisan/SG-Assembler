First alignments of all reads
find overlap

Minimap2 > graph > assembly from scratch
> contigs > scaffolds

longest reads extend them
simplify dataset

Get an idea of minimap 2 output
what does overlap means
How to get a longer contig

try artificial data to know what to expect
real data can have issues
need to know exactly what the outcome looks like
Simulate dataset
30k actg random as acting genome
random substract subregions as reads
generate back original sequence
header as where it had to be

two reads if they overlap, one contig is the output
